Overview
--------

- My plan for this talk is to provide a little bit of introduction to Numba
    - What it is, and;
    - what it does
- But mostly I'd like to focus on talking about its implementation
    - how it works now, and;
    - how it used to work, and has evolved
- I'm hoping that I've focused on things interesting to the LLVM community
- and I'm also interested in your feedback and thoughts on it,
    - and what we could do better or differently.


My background
-------------

- I'm a compiler engineer at Embecosm
    - where I mainly work on GNU toolchains.
- I'm interested in Numba because I used and developed it in my previous job
    - at Continuum Analytics.
    - I spent time with customers, showing them how to get the best out of it
    - and that fed back into improvements in Numba itself.
- My personal interests generally lie in the intersection of:
    - Python
    - High performance computing
    - and Numerical methods
- and Numba is one particular tool that lies in that intersection.
