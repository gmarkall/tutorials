Numba Tutorial
==============

In order to create a suitable environment and get the IPython notebook started
up, run the following commands:

```
conda env create -f=environment.yml
source activate pyconuk-numba # Linux, OS X
activate pyconuk-numba        # Windows
ipython notebook
```

Note that `source activate` is required on Linux and OS X, whereas only
`activate` is required on Windows.

Tutorial exercise notebooks are in the `exercises` directory. Some example codes
optimised with Numba are in the `example_codes` directory. Slide HTML and source
files are in the `slides` directory.
